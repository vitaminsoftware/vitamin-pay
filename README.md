# Vitamin Software Payment System

Handles ad-hoc credit card and Paypal payments for Vitamin Software LLC invoices.
The repo is based on the [Braintree integration for Flask example](https://github.com/braintree/braintree_flask_example).

## Setup Instructions

1. Install requirements:
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

2. Copy the contents of `example.env` into a new file named `.env` and fill in your Braintree API credentials. Credentials can be found by navigating to Account > My User > View Authorizations in the Braintree Control Panel. Full instructions can be [found on our support site](https://articles.braintreepayments.com/control-panel/important-gateway-credentials#api-credentials).

3. Start server:
  ```sh
  python app.py
  ```

By default, this runs the app on port `4567`. You can configure the port by setting the environmental variable `PORT`.

## Usage

The app will process card payments for invoices issued by **Vitamin Software LLC invoices ONLY**. The payment form is unique to each invoice and follows the pattern http://pay.vitaminsoftware.com/checkouts/[invoice]/[amount].
- *invoice* field should match the invoice number we'd like to get paid for;
- *amount* represents the total value of the invoice in cents (USD pence).

For example to receive a payment for invoice **VIT00117** in the amount of **$218.75** the following URL should be distributed to the client: `http://pay.vitaminsoftware.com/checkouts/VIT00117/21875`.

## Running tests

Unit tests do not make API calls to Braintree and do not require Braintree credentials. You can run this project's unit tests by calling `python test_app.py` on the command line.

## Testing Transactions

Sandbox transactions must be made with [sample credit card numbers](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/reference/general/testing/python#credit-card-numbers), and the response of a `Transaction.sale()` call is dependent on the [amount of the transaction](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/reference/general/testing/python#test-amounts).

## Pro Tips

- The `application.cfg.example` contains an `APP_SECRET_KEY` setting. Even in development you should [generate your own custom secret key for your app](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/quickstart/#sessions).
